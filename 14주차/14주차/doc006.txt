A social network is a social structure made up of a set of social actors (such as individuals or organizations) and a complex set of the dyadic ties between these actors. 
The social network perspective provides a clear way of analyzing the structure of whole social entities. 
The study of these structures uses social network analysis to identify local and global patterns, locate influential entities, and examine network dynamics.
Social networks and the analysis of them is an inherently interdisciplinary academic field which emerged from social psychology, sociology, statistics, and graph theory. 
Social network analysis is now one of the major paradigms in contemporary sociology, and is also employed in a number of other social and formal sciences. 
Together with other complex networks, it forms part of the nascent field of network science.
